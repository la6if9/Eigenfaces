# Eigenfaces analysis using Principal Components Analysis

/The data set for this exercise is called faces and in the file faces.RData 
//The data for this analysis consist of 2410 pictures of faces of which the pixels are converted to gray scales in the range (0,255). The pictures all have 8064 pixels ///(96Ã—84). The aim of the analysis to is to create a reduced number of principal components that summarize stereotype faces, a.k.a eigenfaces

1. Load the data
2. Print a summery to have an idea what the data look like
3. Converts the raw data of the first 9 faces to 84 x 96 matrices, and displays an image of the face in gray scales.

4.Perform a PCA on faces
5.Convert the first 9 components scores to 84 x 96 matrices, and display the images of the eigenfaces

6.display the eigenface images produced by the last 9 principal components.

7.Include the raw component scores of the 1st as the sole argument in the plot() function, and also for the 2nd component. These plots do not have any sensible interpretation but they just look nice!
